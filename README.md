# IMChat
v3.0

Using node.js and socket.io implement a page that will allow users to create new channels,
and chat with other people in the same channel.
You may have a default channel set up on startup when no one has connected yet.

If a new channel has been created, users should be able to see the new channels on some type of list 
and switch back and forth between channels as needed. 
Any message sent to a channel should only be seen on that channel.

1. Install NodeJS and npm
2. Execute 'npm install express/sockit.io' to create the node_modules folder from package.json
3. Run program 'node server.js'

Feel free to ask any questions.
